## Installation
1. Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
2. Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a wp-config.php file with your database connection details.
3. Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your site. If there is an error, double check your wp-config.php file, and try again.
4. If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you. If you did not provide a username, it will be admin.
5. The installer should then send you to the login page. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on “Profile” to change the password.
